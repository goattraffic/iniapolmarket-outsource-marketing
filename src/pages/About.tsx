            <h2>Why Choose Outsourced Marketing?</h2>
            <p>
              Building an in-house marketing team means hiring multiple specialists, providing benefits, buying expensive tools, and managing complex workflows. For most SMBs, this represents a significant investment with considerable risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outsourcing your marketing department gives you immediate access to experienced specialists, proven processes, and enterprise-grade tools‚Äîall at a fraction of the cost of building an in-house team. You get flexibility to scale up or down based on your needs, without the commitment of full-time employees.

              <h3>How is outsourcing different from hiring an agency?</h3>
              <p>
                Traditional agencies often work with you on specific projects or campaigns. When you outsource your marketing department to us, we become your ongoing marketing team. We're involved in strategy, execution, and continuous optimization across all your marketing activities.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">

                We primarily serve small to medium-sized businesses with revenue between $1M and $50M. Our clients typically have 10-200 employees and are looking to grow without the overhead of a full in-house marketing team.
              </p>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>How quickly can we get started?</h3>
              <p>
                Most clients are up and running within 2-3 weeks. We start with a comprehensive discovery phase to understand your business, then move quickly into strategy development and execution.

            </div>

            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>What if we already have some marketing in place?</h3>
